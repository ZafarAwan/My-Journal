# My-Journal

## General info
This app allows users to keep a personal journal. For every entry, they can record how they're feeling, and write down some notes. 
On the main screen, the list of entries is grouped by day and by month. The header for the day and month displays a counter for its entries,
and the header for the month also has a background color that's determined by some formula that considers the mood of that month's entries.
All the data is stored locally.
